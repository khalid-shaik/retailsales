## About the project
In retail, being able to predict sales accurately is essential for making smart business decisions. This project focuses on building models to forecast sales by using a dataset that includes various factors affecting sales, such as discounts, marketing spend, and seasonal trends like holidays.

This project will not only predict sales but also evaluate the performance of different models such as linear regression, decision trees, and gradient boosting methods, among others. The comparison will help identify the most effective model for improving sales forecasting accuracy in real-world retail settings.

## Key Objectives:
Build and compare different models to predict retail sales.
Analyze how features like marketing, discounts, and holidays affect sales.
Find the most effective model for forecasting future sales.
